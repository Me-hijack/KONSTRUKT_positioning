                        instructions, they've moved to <a href="#">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an

                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                        and the
                        app platform&apos;s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                        platform&apos;s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
                        components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next
                        section. But
                        first, let&apos;s cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                    <h2 class="title_2">React Fundamentals</h2>
                    <p>React Native runs on <a href="">React</a>, a popular open source library for building user
                        interfaces
                        with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
                        section can
                        get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                    <h3 class="title_3">We&apos;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</h3>
                    <ul class="section_list">
                        <li class="list_item"><strong>+ components. </strong>The rest of this introduction
                            to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a
                            cafe to
                            work in</li>
                        <li class="list_item"><strong>+ JSX. </strong>React and React Native use JSX, a
                            syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: <span
                                class="text_highlight">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;&#47;Text&gt;</span>. The
                            React docs
                            have <a href="#">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can refer to learn even more. Because
                            JSX is
                            JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
                            name, and
                            embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="text_highlight">&lt;Text&gt;</span>.</li>
                        <li class="list_item"><strong>+ props. </strong>Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list_item"><strong>+ state. </strong>While you can think of props as
                            arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a component&apos;s
                            personal data
                            storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
                            interaction. State gives your components memory!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="title_2">Handling Text Input</h2>
                    <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop
                        that takes
                        a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
                        function
                        to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                    <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                        language.
                        In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
                        there Bob"
                        would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
